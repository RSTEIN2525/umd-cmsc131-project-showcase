# Project #5: Array Utilities

**Overview:**  
Developed a `Utilities` class in Java to perform common operations on one-dimensional arrays using static methods. This project emphasized array manipulation, algorithm development, and test-driven development with JUnit.

## Features

- **Static Methods Implemented:**  
  - Array searching, sorting, and other utility operations (specific method details not provided but assumed to include key array-based functions).
  - Avoided use of `ArrayLists` or the `Arrays` class, implementing algorithms manually to deepen understanding of array manipulation.
  - Designed private static helper methods to streamline and modularize functionality.

- **JUnit Testing:**  
  - Wrote comprehensive student tests in `StudentTests.java` using assertions to validate the behavior of all methods.
  - Ensured thorough coverage of edge cases to pass secret and release tests.

## Key Learnings and Challenges

- Practiced efficient manipulation of one-dimensional arrays.
- Designed and implemented algorithms without relying on built-in utilities, enhancing problem-solving skills.
- Developed robust test cases to validate array operations and debug issues systematically.
- Emphasized clean, maintainable code through adherence to style guidelines, including proper indentation, meaningful variable names, and concise logic.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Testing Framework:** JUnit
