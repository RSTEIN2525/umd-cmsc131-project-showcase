# Project #2: Java Loops

**Overview:**  
Implemented three Java programs—**Convert**, **ThrowDie**, and **Access**—to practice using loops and control structures effectively.

## Programs

- **Convert:**  
  Converts a positive decimal number (including 0) to its octal representation using manual division and remainder operations with loops.  
  **Example Run:**  
  ```
  Enter decimal number: 10
  Octal value: 12
  ```

- **ThrowDie:**  
  Simulates throwing a die *n* times. Reads the number of throws and a random seed, then generates and displays the results as 3x3 grid patterns for each throw.  
  **Example Run:**  
  ```
  How many times to throw a die?: 2
  Enter seed: 9
  Throw #1
  0..
  ...
  ..0
  Throw #2
  0.0
  .0.
  0.0
  ```

- **Access:**  
  Simulates a password-protected system with a maximum of three attempts. Prompts the user for a password ("terps") and a number (1847). If incorrect, the program displays "Wrong credentials" and re-prompts. Correct credentials display "Access Granted," while exhausting attempts or entering "quit" results in "Access Denied."  
  **Example Run:**  
  ```
  Enter password: testudo
  Enter number: 1234
  Wrong credentials
  Enter password: terps
  Enter number: 1847
  Access Granted
  ```

## Key Learnings and Challenges

- Applied loop constructs (`while`, `for`) to repetitive tasks, including:
  - Converting numbers to octal format.
  - Generating randomized die throws.
  - Implementing retry logic for secure system access.
- Practiced handling user input and validating edge cases to ensure robust program behavior.
- Emphasized good programming practices: clean variable naming, avoiding code duplication, and commenting significant code portions.

## Technologies Used

- Java
