# Project #1: Java Basics and Conditionals

**Overview:**  
Implemented three Java console applications—**Area**, **Divisible**, and **ColorGenerator**—to practice Java expressions, input/output operations, and conditional logic.

## Programs

- **Area:**  
  Calculates the area of a triangle based on user-provided base and height values.  
  **Example Run:**  
  ```
  Enter base: 7
  Enter height: 5
  Area is: 17.5
  ```

- **Divisible:**  
  Determines whether one integer is divisible by another. Includes remainder calculations and conditional output.  
  **Example Run:**  
  ```
  Enter x: 8
  Enter y: 3
  Remainder: 2
  8 is NOT divisible by 3

  Enter x: 8
  Enter y: 4
  Remainder: 0
  8 is divisible by 4
  ```

- **ColorGenerator:**  
  Generates a CSS color code based on user input for red, green, and blue components using conditional statements.  
  **Example Run:**  
  ```
  Do you want red? (Yes/Yeah/No): Yes
  Do you want green and blue? (Yes/Yeah/No): No
  Final Color: #FF0000

  Do you want red? (Yes/Yeah/No): No
  Do you want green and blue? (Yes/Yeah/No): Yes
  Final Color: #00FFFF
  ```

## Key Learnings and Challenges

- Practiced Java syntax for expressions, I/O operations, and conditionals.
- Designed interactive console applications with structured user prompts.
- Debugged and tested programs thoroughly to pass public and release tests.
- Emphasized clean, readable code through proper indentation and meaningful variable names.

## Technologies Used

- Java
